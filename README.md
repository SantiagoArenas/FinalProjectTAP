# FinalProjectTAP  
Final Project for Telematic Applications Programming (Web Design).  

# Project Planning  

### Roadmap Definition:  
The project was planned in two iterations of two weeks each, following an "agile development" cycle. Each iteration has clear objectives, prioritizing essential tasks to ensure steady and measurable progress.  
Two-week sprints were chosen due to the high academic workload at this stage of the course and the realistic expectation that some weeks would allow little work. The initial planning is designed to be adaptable and flexible.  

#### Iteration 1 (Week 1 - Week 2):  
- **Objectives:**  
  - Develop the backend for managing doctors.  
  - Implement basic registration and login functionalities.  
  - Design the future development of the frontend for implemented features.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Backend:  
    - Set up the Spring Boot project.  
    - Implement the API to register doctors.  
    - Implement the API for doctor login.  
    - Design the initial database model.  
    - Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration.  
  - Frontend:  
    - Set up the frontend project.  
    - Design the user interface for registration and login.  
    - Implement the logic to connect with the backend API.  
    - Create reusable components.  
  - Initial documentation of the design and architecture.  

#### Iteration 2 (Week 3 - Week 4):  
- **Objectives:**  
  - Develop the backend for knowledge management.  
  - Implement advanced functionalities for updating and deleting doctors.  
  - Refine the CI/CD system.  
  - Develop the frontend for the new functionalities.  
  - Complete the final documentation and presentation.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Backend:  
    - Implement the API for managing knowledge.  
    - Implement the API for updating and deleting doctors' information.  
    - Improve the GitHub Actions configuration for CI/CD.  
    - Develop and implement tests.  
  - Frontend:  
    - Design the user interface for knowledge management.  
    - Implement the logic to connect with the backend API for knowledge management.  
    - Enhance user experience and usability.  
  - Prepare the final project presentation.
